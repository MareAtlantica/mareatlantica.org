* added : (php, class-content-post_metas.php) Now handles any custom or built-in taxonomies associated with built-in or custom post types.

New filter created : tc_exclude_taxonomies_from_metas, with default value : array('post_format') => allows to filter which taxonomy to displays in metas with a customizable granularity since it accepts 2 parameters : post type and post id.
