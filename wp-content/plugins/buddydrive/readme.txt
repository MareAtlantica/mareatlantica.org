== Description ==

BuddyDrive is a BuddyPress plugin (it requires at least version 2.0) that uses WordPress built in features for the management of its post attachments to allow the members of a community to share a file or a list of files thanks to the BuddyDrive folders.
Depending on the BuddyPress settings, the access to the BuddyDrive user's content can be restricted to :

* the owner of the item only,
* people that know the password the owner set for his item,
* the friends of the owner of the file,
* the members of the group the content is attached to,
* or everybody !

This plugin is available in english and french.
